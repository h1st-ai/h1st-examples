This is a super quick guide to using H1st!

You can & should examine each file and run each example individually:

```
python3 rule_based_model.py
python3 ml_model.py
python3 helloworld_graph.py
```

To quickly see everything in action at once, run the test suite:

```
% nose2
```

Some of the examples may require that you install various standard frameworks, e.g., `scikitlearn`.

```
% pip3 install -U scikit-learn nose2
```

For a more complex example that demonstrate the power of H1st graph in a real-world use case,
